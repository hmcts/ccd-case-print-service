Limiting the input length to 150 characters should be sufficient in most cases.","references":"- [Issue #10](https://github.com/indexzero/TimeSpan.js/issues/10)","access":"public","severity":"low","cwe":"CWE-400","metadata":{"module_type":"Multi.Library","exploitability":5,"affected_components":""},"url":"https://npmjs.com/advisories/533"}}}
