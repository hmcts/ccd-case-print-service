[31m[1mUsage Error[22m[39m: The nearest package directory (/Users/ankitasrivastava/Documents/NodeJS-Repos/ccd-case-print-service) doesn't seem to be part of the project declared in /Users/ankitasrivastava.

- If /Users/ankitasrivastava isn't intended to be a project, remove any yarn.lock and/or package.json file there.
- If /Users/ankitasrivastava is intended to be a project, it might be that you forgot to list Documents/NodeJS-Repos/ccd-case-print-service in its workspace configuration.
- Finally, if /Users/ankitasrivastava is fine and you intend Documents/NodeJS-Repos/ccd-case-print-service to be treated as a completely separate project (not even a workspace), create an empty yarn.lock file in it.
